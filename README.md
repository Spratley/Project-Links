This repository is just links to my other projects that aren't on my Github

I have several games on my itch.io page, so head over there to check them out!

I joined Ubisoft Toronto in 2020 and have been there since, as part of the AI team on the Far Cry brand.\
So far, I have helped deliver [Far Cry 6](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/far-cry/far-cry-6), as well as the DLC [Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds](https://www.ign.com/articles/far-cry-6-lost-between-worlds-dlc-review)

**[Outdated]**\
[Final Slice](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/final-slice), created for Global Game Jam 2019. I was responsible for the wolf AI, and scoring systems.\
Final Slice was one of my first endeavors into formal AI development and helped spur on my interest in creating NPCs. While this project is old and far from demonstrative of my skillset, I wouldn't be the AAA AI programmer without starting somewhere :)
